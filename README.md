# Rename-script
my personal noob renaming script for my overloaded Anime collection

It makes any mkv file(s) in any folder which have lot of parenthesis or brackets into more tolerable naming sense.
For example 

`12file(99009909090){89uu23123}[123091283021983]11.mkv will be converted into 12file11.mkv`

This scripts removes any text inside parenthesis or brackets. Supported characters are {} [] (). YOU can add way more HOW?. Its written inside script.

For xfce thunar Custom action Custom command will be 
`exo-open --working-directory %f --launch TerminalEmulator (path to rename.sh)`

I use Arch btw
